# **Twitter Spam Detection Using Encoder and Decoder Model**

## **Overview**
This project implements a spam detection system for Twitter using an encoder-decoder model. The system is built with TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify text messages as spam or not spam.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Reads and preprocesses the text data from a CSV file.
- **Label Encoding:** Encodes the labels for the classification task.
- **Tokenization and Padding:** Tokenizes the text data and pads sequences to a fixed length.
- **Encoder-Decoder Model:** Defines and trains both encoder and decoder models.
- **Performance Visualization:** Plots training and validation accuracy and loss.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance on test data.
